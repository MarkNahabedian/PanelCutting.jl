The Unitful package (and optionally UnitfulUS) are used so we can specify units for the box dimensions.\n\nusing PanelCutting, Unitful, UnitfulUS\n\nmy_box = Box(0.3u\"m\", 0.2u\"m\", 0.1u\"m\")\n\nThe Box has six faces which are identified by singleton types.  The faces come in three opposite pairs: Top and Bottom, Left and Right, and Front and Back.\n\nOnce a box is defined, one can specify whether each face is open, or the thickness of the panel for that face.  One can also specify what material should be used.  The material is just a string that must match that of an AvailablePanel in order for that panel to be considered.\n\nmy_box.open[Top()] = true\n\ndo_faces(my_box) do face\n    # All faces are 1/4\" baltic birch:\n    my_box.thickness[face] = (1/4)u\"inch\"\n    my_box.material[face] = \"Baltic Birch\"\nend\n\nFor each face of a box, one can also specify the grain direction (also represented by singleton types), one of GDLong(the default), GDShort or GDEither.\n\nmy_box.grain_direction[Bottom()] = GDEither()\n\nA Box also has edges.  An edge is identified by a pair of faces. Edge(Front(), Bottom()) specifies the edge where the bottom and front panels of the box meet.\n\nOne can specify the joint type to be used for each edge.  The joint type affects this sizes of the panels which meet at that edge.  For a butt joint, one face is shortened by the thickness of the other.  For a finger joint, both panels would be at full length.  For a dado/tongue and grrove joint, one panel is shortened by the thickness of the other but lengthened by the tongue length.\n\nlet\n    # Use finger joints between each pair of sides:\n    sides = [Left(), Back(), Right(), Front()]\n    for i in 0:(length(sides) - 1)\n        e = Edge(sides[i + 1],\n                 sides[1 + (i + 1) % length(sides)])\n        my_box.joint_types[e] = FingerJoint()\n    end\n    # Use a dado joint for each edge of the bottom:\n    for n in neighbors(Bottom())\n        edge = Edge(Bottom(), n)\n        my_box.joint_types[edge] = DadoJoint(Bottom(), 2u\"mm\")\n    end\nend\n\nOnce the box is fully specified, we can ask about the panels it requires, its WantedPanels:\n\nWantedPanels(my_box)\n\nTo make our box, we first need sheet stock, which comes from a Supplier.\n\nBOULTER_PLYWOOD = Supplier(\n    name = \"Boulter Plywood\",\n    kerf = (1/8)u\"inch\",\n    cost_per_cut = money(1.50),\n    available_stock = [\n        AvailablePanel(;\n            label = \"1/4 5 × 5 Baltic Birch\",\n            material = \"Baltic Birch\",\n            thickness = (1/4)u\"inch\",\n            length = 5u\"ft\",\n            width = 5u\"ft\",\n            cost = 84.00   # I've not been able to get UnitfulCurrency to work\n        ),\n        AvailablePanel(;\n            label = \"1/4 30 × 60 Baltic Birch\",\n            material = \"Baltic Birch\",\n            thickness = (1/4)u\"inch\",\n            length = 60u\"inch\",\n            width = 30u\"inch\",\n            cost = 51.00\n        ),\n        AvailablePanel(;\n            label = \"1/4 30 × 30 Baltic Birch\",\n            material = \"Baltic Birch\",\n            thickness = (1/4)u\"inch\",\n            length = 30u\"inch\",\n            width = 30u\"inch\",\n            cost = 36.00)\n      ])\n\nNow we can figure out where to make the cuts.
